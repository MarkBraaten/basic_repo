Firstly I navigated to my desktop then used md basic_repo
From there I used git init to create a local repository,
I used the command echo to add text straight into my "myCat.txt" file
and then did the same for my index.html file.
At this point I used git add . to add both of the files to staging followed by
"git commit -m "initial commit""

I then used "git remote add origin https://github.com/MarkBraaten/basic_repo.git" 
 and "git push -u origin master" to comment
to my git hub repository

After that I opened VSC to add HTML tags to my index.html and added
a second line of text to myCat.txt file.

followed by restaging and commiting the two files to my repository.
